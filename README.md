# Python OOP Seminar

## Overview

Welcome to my Python OOP Seminar repository! This repository contains the projects and tasks I completed during a **10-week intensive seminar** focused on Python Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Throughout this seminar, I tackled various problems that helped me deepen my understanding of OOP principles, inheritance, polymorphism, and method overloading. This journey significantly enhanced my coding skills and brought me closer to my goal of becoming a DevOps professional.

## Seminar Highlights

### Duration
- **10 Weeks**: A structured and rigorous program designed to build a strong foundation in Python OOP.

### Topics Covered
- **Basic Python Programming**: Understanding and implementing the base aspects of python from beginner to intermediate.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Understanding the core concepts of OOP such as classes, objects, methods, and encapsulation.
- **Inheritance**: Learning how to create subclasses that inherit from parent classes, promoting code reuse and organization.
- **Polymorphism**: Implementing polymorphic behavior to allow different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface.
- **Method Overloading**: Exploring how to define methods with the same name but different parameters, enhancing functionality and flexibility.

## Projects and Tasks

Each week of the seminar presented unique challenges that required practical application of the concepts learned. Below is an overview of some of the key projects and tasks included in this repository:

1. **Week 1: Introduction to Python**
   - Basic syntax and setup
   - Writing simple Python scripts
   - Understanding variables and data types

2. **Week 2: Control Flow Structure**
   - Conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `elif`)
   - Nested conditions
   - Practical examples and exercises

3. **Week 3: Loops**
   - `for` and `while` loops
   - Loop control statements (`break`, `continue`, `pass`)
   - Iterating over different data structures

4. **Week 4: Functions**
   - Defining and calling functions
   - Function arguments and return values
   - Lambda functions and higher-order functions

5. **Week 5: Lists and Data Structures**
   - Working with lists, tuples, and dictionaries
   - List comprehensions
   - Advanced data structure manipulation

6. **Week 6: Introduction to OOP**
   - Basic class and object creation
   - Implementing methods and properties
   - Understanding `__init__` and `self`

7. **Week 7: OOP Programming**
   - Class and instance variables
   - Method overloading and overriding
   - Encapsulation and data hiding

8. **Week 8: Encapsulation - Getters & Setters**
   - Implementing getter and setter methods
   - Property decorators
   - Encapsulation best practices

9. **Week 9: Inheritance**
   - Single and multiple inheritance
   - Using composition to build complex objects
   - Exploring the `super()` function

10. **Week 10: Polymorphism + Overloading**
    - Abstract base classes and interfaces
    - Implementing polymorphic functions
    - Method overloading techniques
    - Practical examples of polymorphism in real-world scenarios

## Learning Outcomes

- **Enhanced Coding Skills**: Improved my ability to write clean, efficient, and reusable code using OOP principles.
- **Problem-Solving Abilities**: Gained experience in tackling complex problems and designing robust solutions.
- **Career Advancement**: Equipped with the necessary skills and knowledge to pursue a career in DevOps, with a strong foundation in Python programming.
